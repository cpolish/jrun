# jrun
A Bash script to quickly compile and run single-file Java programs

## Usage
Download the `jrun.sh` file or clone this repository.

Ensure that `jrun.sh` is executable - use `chmod +x jrun.sh` if needed.

Run the program as follows:

```bash
./jrun.sh <classname>.java [java args...]
```

It might be handy to place the script somewhere in your `PATH` - that way it will be able to be executed from any directory.
